A tool which allows us to monitor large scale operations like company operations.
Advantage is that it's cloud based and can be used everywhere

It not just monitoring the clients and gives reports to the users of the clients and it doesn't have anything to do with spyware


Example Scenerio
The company given laptop doesn't boot up for professional complains you need to raise ticket so Servicenow can be run in other devices of the same client so the Servicenow just captures the problem and sends a ticket to the appropriate branch or people

Ticket are prioritized

Priority 1 - need to be solved within 4 hours (resolution time) and should be responded in 15 min
Priority 2- need to be solved within 8 hours(resolution time)  response time has has 15 min 
Priority 3 has resolution time of 15 hr to 2  days and 4 has ample amount of time
